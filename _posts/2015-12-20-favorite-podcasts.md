### 2015 has been the year of the podcast. These are some of my favorites from the year.

## [The Tim Ferriss Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/)

![Tim Ferriss Show](/images/posts/podcasts/tim-ferriss.jpg "Tim Ferriss Show"){:.img-33vh}

In-depth interviews with stellar, broad-ranging guests who are at the very top of their fields. Full of insightful nuggets of wisdom, and tactics of success to apply to your own life. 

My recommendation would be to start with a few names you recognize and branch out from there. A few of my favorites from 2015:

- [Derek Sivers](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/)
- [Jamie Foxx](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/06/jamie-foxx/)
- [BJ Novak](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/25/bj-novak/)
- [Reid Hoffman](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/08/31/the-oracle-of-silicon-valley-reid-hoffman-plus-michael-mccullough/)
- [Kevin Kelly](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/08/07/kevin-kelly-on-artificial-intelligence-and-designer-babies/)
- [Maria Popova](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/24/maria-popova-starting-a-successful-blog/)
- [Rick Rubin](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/05/15/rick-rubin/)
- [Arnold Schwarzenegger](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/02/arnold-schwarzenegger/)

Seriously, that was just the shortlist...

## [Limetown](http://www.limetownstories.com/)

![Limetown](/images/posts/podcasts/limetown.jpg "Limetown"){:.img-33vh}

I get the same feeling I did during the first season of Lost, delivered through a modern radio drama. I sent this to a number of friends, a couple who took it to be a true story. It's that good. Chilling and suspenseful. 

Season 1 has ended, so it's a great time to catch up. Really hope we see more like this in 2016. 

## [99 Percent Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) & [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/)

Mentioned together since these are the originals to me, and have only increased in quality over the years. These would make my list going back all the way to when I first heard of podcasts. 

![99 Percent Invisible](/images/posts/podcasts/99-percent-invisible.jpg "99 Percent Invisible"){:.img-33vh}

99 Percent Invisible: fascinating explorations of the invisible, unseen aspects of design and architecture all around us. [Roman Mars'](https://twitter.com/romanmars) voice is probably enough to get anyone hooked though. 

![Radiolab](/images/posts/podcasts/radiolab.jpg "Radiolab"){:.img-33vh}

Radiolab: [Jad](https://twitter.com/JadAbumrad) and [Robert](https://twitter.com/rkrulwich) explore questions of science, philosophy, emotion, etc. through enthralling stories with unique and captivating production. 

# Honorable Mentions

## [Product Hunt](https://soundcloud.com/product-hunt)

![Product Hunt Podcast](/images/posts/podcasts/product-hunt.jpg "Product Hunt Podcast"){:.img-33vh}

Started off more for product geeks, looking at the people behind the products. More recently has been [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg) interviewing a broad range of makers and leaders in a Tim-Ferriss-esque format. He is turning into a great interviewer, so I will continue to follow him. 

## [Hidden Brain](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510308/hidden-brain)

![Hidden Brain](/images/posts/podcasts/hidden-brain.jpg "Hidden Brain"){:.img-33vh}

Relatively new, but absolutely great so far. Explores the surprising science of the brain and human psychology.
