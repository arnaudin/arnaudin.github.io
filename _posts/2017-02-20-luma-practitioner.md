I've attended three LUMA trainings in Human-Centered Design (Fundamentals, Advancing, and Facilitation), and have been practicing the methods whenever possible in my UX Design work at Autodesk, including Autodesk University 2016.

Today I want to share that I have completed the requirements of the Practitioner Development Program, and am officially a Certified Practitioner. Next step: Certified Facilitator!
