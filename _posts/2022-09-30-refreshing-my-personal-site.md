I’ll be refreshing and overhauling my personal site at [https://ryanarnaudin.com/](https://ryanarnaudin.com/) in the coming weeks.

This post is a rough outline to guide the update.

## Why?

My existing site, 'v2,' is nearly [seven years old](https://ryanarnaudin.com/blog/hello-world/). I'm currently on a sabbatical from full-time work, and this is a key result for finding new work later this year. I have several reasons for initiating a refresh now:

1.  As my sabbatical winds down, I'll be looking for work. A personal site or web portfolio is essential for getting interviews and securing a good UX/Product Design job.
2.  The v2 site is outdated:
    -   Google's Material Design, which has evolved over the years, inspired it.
    -   The portfolio hasn't been updated in five years, so it's missing my work at Brightidea.
3.  Recently, I've been working as a Product Lead and PM, so I've had less hands-on time with tools and technology. This is an opportunity to refamiliarize technically with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll, GitHub, and web hosting during my downtime.
4.  It's a fun design project that I've been delaying due to other priorities.

## Requirements and Constraints

Many of these remain constant from v2:

1.  Provide an overview of the skills and experience that I can leverage to advance an interested compnay.
2.  Highlight work samples in a design portfolio for recruiters and hiring managers to become familiar with my process and problem-solving approach.
3.  Showcase writing samples to illustrate my thinking process and communitcation style.
    -   Other benefits include sharing ideas, preserving knowledge, and practicing writing skills.
4.  Provide a way for people to contact me for work opportunities or collaboration.
5.  Tech-wise:
    -   I plan on sticking with a similar tech stack despite newer options, since I'm familiar with Jekyll, which has served me well. A static site is sufficient for my needs.
    -   Keep scripts, plugins, and complexity to a minimum to accomplish the goals.
6.  Design-wise:
    -   The site should be simple and professional. I prefer dark mode for apps, but a high-contrast, light aesthetic accomplishes the goal best. Fonts, styling, and hierarchy should be minimal yet elegant, to focus the content.
    -   As a usability expert, my site must have clear and straightforward navigation and operation. It needs to work well on mobile and desktop. Styling shouldn't obscure purpose. A pet peeve is portfolio sites that get in the way, or that I can't effectively navigate. 
    -   Avoid short-lived trends and aesthetics for a long-lasting, expandable site (purples & pinks, mesh gradients, bubbly and/or 3D effects, dark glassy effects are all hot at the time of writing).

## Solution Direction

In keeping with the constraints and principles above, I aim for something like this:

I've idenfitied a few open-source Jekyll themes that will get me close. The leading candidate is [himatt](https://github.com/MattGreyDesign/himatt.com), unless there are any issues or concerns when I clone the project. Aside from migrating my content, the major tasks would be:

-   Change the theme from dark to light.
-   Add a blog list and post pages.
-   Add an image lightbox that opens large in the same window.

## Future Considerations

It's worth mentioning what might be tempting, but I'm not planning on doing now:

-   Image galleries.
-   Additional filtering and categorization, e.g. blog or project categories.
-   Minimal migration effort now for side projects and hobbies.
-   Serve as a landing page and funnel for potential consulting work and/or resources for sale, but aiming for a full-time job.
