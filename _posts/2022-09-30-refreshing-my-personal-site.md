Over the coming weeks, I will be refreshing & overhauling my personal site here at [https://ryanarnaudin.com/](https://ryanarnaudin.com/). 

This post is a rough outline to guide the update.

## Why?

My existing site, which I will refer to as 'v2,' is nearly [seven years old](/blog/hello-world/). I am currently on a sabbatical from full-time work and this is a key result for finding new work towards the end of the year. Thus, I have several reasons for initiating a refresh now:

1. As my sabbatical winds down, I'll be looking for work. A personal site or web portfolio is practically essential for getting interviews and landing a good UX/Product Design job.
2. The v2 site is showing its age:
- Design-wise it was inspired by Google's Material Design, which has gone through several iterations in the passing years.
- The portfolio content has not been updated in five years, so is missing anything I did at Brightidea.
3. I have recently been working as a Product Lead and PM, so have had less hands-on time with tools and technology. This is an opportunity to refamiliarize technically with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll, Github, and all things web hosting while I still have downtime.
4. It's a fun design project I've been putting off due to other priorities.

## Requirements and Constraints

Many of these remain constant from v2:

1. Provide an overview of my professional skills & experience for recruiters & hiring managers
2. Highlight work samples in the form of a design portfolio for recruiters & hiring managers
3. Showcase writing samples to illustrate my thinking process for hiring managers
- Other benefits: sharing ideas, preserving knowledge, and practicing communication skills
3. Provide a way for people to get in touch with me for work opportunities or collaboration
4. Tech-wise:
- My previous site was built on Jekyll which has served me well. Since I am familiar with how it works and a static site is sufficient for my needs, I plan on sticking with a similar tech stack even though there are newer options.
- Keep scripts and plugins to a minimum to accomplish the goals.
5. Design-wise:
- The site should be simple and professional. While I personally like dark mode for apps, I believe a high-contrast, light aesthetic accomplishes the goal best. Fonts and styling should be kept to the minimum required.
- As a usability expert, navigation and operation of my site must be clear and straightforward. It needs to work as well on mobile as on desktop. Styling should not obscure purpose.
- Avoid trends and aesthetics that are likely to age quickly (might include purples & pinks, mesh gradients, bubbly and/or 3D effects, dark with glassy effects, etc.), so that the site may have a long life while expanding with content

## Solution Direction

In keeping with the constraints and principles above, I'm aiming for something like this:

*Wireframes to guide the update of my site: project details, blog list, project list & homepage*

I've identified a handful of open-source Jekyll themes that should get me close to this. [himatt](https://github.com/MattGreyDesign/himatt.com) is the leading candidate, barring any issues or red flags I encounter when I clone the project. Aside from migrating my content into the theme, it looks like the big pieces would be:

- Update theme from dark to light
- Add a blog list and post pages
- Add an image lightbox (open large in the same window)

## Future Considerations

It's worth mentioning explicitly what might be tempting, but I am not planning on doing now:

- Image galleries 
- Additional filtering, categorization, etc. -- for example, blog or project categories
- Minimal migration effort at this time for side projects and hobbies/interests 
- Serve as a landing page and funnel for consulting work and/or resources for sale (aim right now is for a full-time job)

You're reading this on the new site, so you probably don't need this to show you how it looks! Here it is anyways:
