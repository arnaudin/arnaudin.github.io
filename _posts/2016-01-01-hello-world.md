## Hello World 

I'll be migrating a number of items to this site in the coming weeks including learnings, thinkings, and doings.

In the meantime, you can find out what I'm doing [Now](/now), or connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.social-username.twitter }}) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.social-username.linkedin }}). 

*Edit October 6, 2022: As I am in the process of once again updating my site, the links here will no longer be accurate. I've copied the previous version that this post references to [/sites/v2/](https://ryanarnaudin.com/sites/v2/), but I didn't put much effort into the rebuild so I suspect some of the image & link paths will be broken.*
