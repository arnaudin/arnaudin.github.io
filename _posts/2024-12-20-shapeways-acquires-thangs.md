For nearly two years I've been designing [Thangs](https://thangs.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Physna's](https://physna.com/){:target="_blank"} consumer-facing product for 3D creators and makers. 

[On Dec 18, Shapeways announced their acquisition of the platform](https://www.shapeways.com/presscorner/shapeways-acquires-thangs){:target="_blank"}.

This marks the end of my journey with Physna & Thangs. I wish the best to my teammates, the new owners, and the 3D community who has supported us over the years!
