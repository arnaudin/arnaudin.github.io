This is a quick exploration to provide a wide array of articulate language to describe a user experience. Too often we default back to the same handful of adjectives that might include favorites like <code>intuitive</code>, <code>user-friendly</code>, <code>confusing</code>, or <code>ugly</code>. 

I am somewhat inspired by Orwell's [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/) while writing this, but don't take a cynical stance. While he goes on to suggest that language may be used to manipulate or deceive in certain contexts, I am creating this as a way to illuminate and increase clarity of communication when building things with a team.

## Positive UX:

- <strong>Easy-to-use:</strong> accessible, clear, effective, efficient, effortless, frictionless, intuitive, simple, straightforward, streamlined, usable, user-friendly
- <strong>Enjoyable:</strong> captivating, delightful, engaging, exciting, fun, immersive, playful, pleasurable, rewarding, satisfying
- <strong>Helpful:</strong> clear, concise, guiding, helpful, informative, relevant, supportive
- <strong>Appealing:</strong> aesthetic, appealing, beautiful, clean, elegant, modern, sexy, stylish
- <strong>Credible:</strong> authentic, credible, professional, reliable, trustworthy

## Negative UX:

- <strong>Difficult-to-use:</strong> clunky, complicated, confusing, cumbersome, difficult, frustrating, inaccessible, overwhelming, unusable
- <strong>Unpleasant:</strong> annoying, boring, frustrating, jarring, tedious, unpleasant
- <strong>Unhelpful:</strong> irrelevant, misleading, unhelpful, uninformative, vague
- <strong>Unappealing:</strong> amateurish, busy, cluttered, confusing, outdated, ugly
- <strong>Untrustworthy:</strong> deceptive, sketchy, suspicious, unreliable, untrustworthy

This is just a start and is meant to provide descriptive alternatives to whatever your standard fallback might be! The best adjectives will always depend on the specific UX you're describing.

## Bonus Qualities

- <strong>Unique:</strong> creative, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, innovative, inspired, original
- <strong>Purpose-built:</strong> efficient (for professional work), user-centered, inclusive, personalized, productive
