intro: |
  The design feedback loop provided by digital simulation is a part of a broad collaborative and interactive process. The Simulation Viewer is a step towards making results immediately sharable and available anywhere, along with additional collaboration features such as basic annotation and commenting. We like to think of it as Google Docs for simulation.
  
  **Role:** I interfaced with the platform A360 Viewer team and designed the UI, interactions, and visual components for the simulation layer of the viewer. 

  Ultimately my work on this project was integrated into the [A360 web viewer](https://a360.autodesk.com/), A360 mobile app, and Autodesk Labs Sim 360 project which all now support simulation results viewing. This was the first time users could share results without sending an actual fileâ€”which often was impossible or prohibitive due to file sizes (e.g. via email).
