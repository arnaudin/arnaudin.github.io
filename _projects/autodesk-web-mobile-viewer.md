intro: |
  The design feedback loop provided by simulation is a part of a collaborative and interactive process. The Simulation Viewer is a step towards making results broadly sharable and available anywhere, along with additional collaboration features such as annotation and commenting. We like to think of it as a Google Doc for simulation.
  
  I designed UI, interactions, and visual components for the simulation layer of the viewer, which was built on top of existing Autodesk 3D viewing technology. 

  Ultimately my work on this project was integrated into the A360 web viewer, A360 mobile app, and Autodesk Labs Sim 360 project.
