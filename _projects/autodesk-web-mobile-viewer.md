      **Role:** As User Experience Designer for engineering simulation, I interfaced with the Autodesk platform team to designed UI, interactions, and visual components for the simulation layer of the Autodesk 360 web experience (A360), including 3D viewer. I also designed conceptual explorations for mobile experiences for simulation monitoring.

      ## Mobile Simulation Monitoring 

      This design-led visioning project stemmed from user feedback related to monitoring simulations that were running on the Autodesk cloud. I designed the workflow, created mockups, and built a simple prototype in conjunction with an Android development course I was taking. (The app read static data rather than live via API, and was never productized.)

      **Problem:** Simulation jobs can only be monitored and managed from the source compuater–often a desktop engineering computer that remains in the office.

      A typical workflow is that an engineer will submit several simulation jobs to solve in the afternoon before leaving the office, and will want to monitor them that evening as they run. If something unexpected occurs they could often make a quick fix, resubmit the job, and still have results in the morning.
      
      **Solution:** Mobile Job Monitor provides a simple way to check the progress and status of cloud simulations, which may take hours or sometimes even days to complete. Log in with your Autodesk account and you can view currently-running and recently-completed jobs. A further enhancement would be allowing changes to input parameters like boundary conditions, material properties, or mesh resolution–without having to open or access the original simulation file.

      ### Visual Design for Simulation Results Legend

      Simulation provides additional design feedback loops as part of an iterative, collaborative process. The Simulation Viewer is a step towards making results immediately sharable and available anywhere while enabling basic collaboration like annotation and commenting. We like to think of it as Google Docs for simulation results.

      Ultimately my work on this project was integrated into the [A360 web viewer](https://a360.autodesk.com/), A360 mobile app, and Autodesk Sim 360–all of which now support simulation results viewing. This was the first time users could share results without sending an actual file—which often was impossible or prohibitive due to large sizes (e.g. via email).
