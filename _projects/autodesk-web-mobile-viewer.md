      **Role:** As the UX Designer for simulation, I interfaced with the platform A360 Viewer team and designed UI, interactions, and visual components for the simulation layer of the common 3D viewer.

      Simulation provides additional design feedback loops as part of an iterative, collaborative process. The Simulation Viewer is a step towards making results immediately sharable and available anywhere while enabling basic collaboration like annotation and commenting. We like to think of it as Google Docs for simulation results.

      Ultimately my work on this project was integrated into the [A360 web viewer](https://a360.autodesk.com/), A360 mobile app, and Autodesk Sim 360--all of which now support simulation results viewing. This was the first time users could share results without sending an actual file—which often was impossible or prohibitive due to large sizes (e.g. via email).
