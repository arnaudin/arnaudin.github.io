intro: |
  Autodesk CFD is a professional yet easy-to-use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool for engineers; in other words, an approachable way to simulate fluid flow & heat transfer in order to understand how your designs will perform in the real world. It is used to simulate everything from pumps & valves, to electronics cooling, to aero & hydrodynamics, to HVAC systems in buildings. All you need is a 3D model of your design and a basic understanding of its operating environment. 
  
  As a product, our CFD is designed to embrace the belief that simulating design performance virtually, early, and often in the design cycle will result in cheaper and better performing real-world designs, with a faster time to market.

  Note: Autodesk CFD is built upon the [CFdesign technology acquired from Blue Ridge Numerics in 2011](/projects/cfdesign/).

      ## Role and Responsibilities

      I was the UX Design Lead for Autodesk's computational fluid dynamics (CFD) apps from 2011 until 2017, supporting the following successful releases:
      
      - Autodesk Simulation CFD 2012
      - Autodesk Simulation CFD 2013
      - Autodesk Simulation CFD 2014
      - Autodesk Simulation CFD 2015
      - Autodesk CFD 2016
      - Autodesk CFD 2017

      In this role I owned user experience and product design, supporting most new development initiatives. Responsibilities include:
      
      - User research
      - Product design strategy, planning, & facilitation
      - UI, interaction design, and prototyping
      - Visual Design
      - Front-end development (XAML-based WPF UIs)
      - Usability testing
      - Design evangelism and cultural evolution
      - Prior to this work at Autodesk, I was involved in the design, testing, and release of eight consecutive on-time quarterly releases of CFdesign simulation software.
      
      For case studies drop me a line. An example of a large scale UI redesign follows.

      ### Interface and Interaction Design

      The following images show the general process: starting from low-fi sketches exploring broad design concepts, to digital wireframes, to mockups, to actual UI prototyping, and finally to polishing the visual

      ### Feedback and Additional Work

      Finally, nothing is as satisfying as positive user feedback:

        > I've used a lot of software since entering the product research field. Some were not too difficult to figure out, while others did require a bit of study to get running. Autodesk Simulation CFD 2013 is one of the easiest I've encountered.
        > <br><br>
        > Anyone fresh into a new piece of software can feel a bit out of sorts, but CFD is laid out in my favorite manner: a progressive ribbon. By this I mean a ribbon layout that works from left to right in the general order that parallels the standard workflows expected.
        > <br><br>
        > The interesting thing to note here is that I never studied how to manipulate planes in CFD. I just followed my instincts, and the tools were there. Nice job usability.

      This particular project serves as a broad example of my approach and skillset. I have designed a majority of the new and redesigned features in the products listed above, so am happy to answer additional questions and requests.
