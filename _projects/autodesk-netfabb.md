intro: |
  [Autodesk Netfabb](https://www.autodesk.com/products/netfabb/overview) is a suite of tools for streamlining and optimizing additive manufacturing processes. 
  
  I served as Lead Designer for the Netfabb Simulation Utility for the 2017 and 2018 product releases. This is a standalone application within the suite that enables engineers to simulate professional-grade metal printing processes for complex parts in order to [predict distortion](https://blogs.autodesk.com/netfabb/2018/10/30/netfabb-simulation-research-validation-distortion-compensation/), [alleviate support structure failure](https://blogs.autodesk.com/netfabb/2018/06/12/netfabb-simulation-research-validation-support-failure-prediction/), and [avoid potential damage](https://blogs.autodesk.com/netfabb/2018/06/12/netfabb-simulation-research-validation-moving-source/) to machines & hardware. Metal printing is inherently expensive and time-consuming, so using simulation to avoid errors is a major cost saver for our customers. 
  
  Being a new product within the Netfabb suite, I was deeply involved in market, industry, and user research. This also enabled me to get my first exposure to product management, as I was more involved than ever in strategic planning and formulating the product roadmap. Our small team was able to function like a startup within the larger company, working closely with early adopters and moving fast to test our hypotheses in working code as part of a tight feedback loop with real users who were testing weekly builds.

      ### Impact

      Simulating the manufacturing process has saved our customers millions of dollars in lost time, expended materials, and damaged machinery.
