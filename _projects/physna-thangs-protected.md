      Physna, short for "physical DNA," is the parent company of Thangs, the world's first geometric search engine and [largest online community](https://venturebeat.com/games/physnas-thangs-hits-20m-monthly-users-for-its-3d-art-community/) for 3D model creators. With more than 24 million indexed 3D models, Thangs enables 3D enthusiasts to find, share, and sell 3D models for the physical and metaverse worlds. 
      
      I served as Lead Product Designer for Physna’s consumer 3D offerings under the Thangs brand, including web app, iOS & Android apps, Windows & Mac app, membership platform, and model store.
