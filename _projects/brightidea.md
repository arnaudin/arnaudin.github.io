intro: |
  Brightidea is a cloud-based idea and innovation management platform that helps companies ensure the best ideas win. We provide an engaging experience for employees and professional-grade management tools that make Brightidea the [#1 customer-rated idea management platform](https://www.g2.com/products/brightidea/reviews) for 3 years running. Brightidea has served over 2.5 million users worldwide, and more than $15 billion in customer-reported business impact has been logged on the platform.

  **Role:** I started at Brightidea as a Product Designer and transitioned to a Product Management role soon after. As a startup PM I most often also supported my team with Product, UX, and UI design.

      ## Idea Management Fundamentals

      [Gartner describes idea management as](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/idea-management): "a structured process of generating, capturing, discussing and improving, organizing, evaluating and prioritizing valuable insight or alternative thinking that would otherwise not have emerged through normal processes."

      As a new Product Manager a theme I focused on was idea management fundamentals for our managers, moderators, and admins. A driving insight was that over the past few years customers had grown from running *an* idea management program or a handful of isolated processes to running an interconnected system of programs & processes. For example, the winners of a problem solving challenge might move into an incubator or perhaps be fast-tracked to executive review in an upcoming pitch competition. 
      
      In this new environment, what actions will be taken, and what tools support that? We dug into our users' goals, broke the process down to first principles, evaluated our current offerings, revamped some areas, and built out new capabilities where needed. For example:

        - Move idea(s)
        - Copy idea(s)
        - Link ideas
        - Merge ideas
        - Tagging and categorization
        - Search

      ## Integrations

      Another area of focus was leading development teams to build general purpose and native integrations for a variety of user goals including: capturing ideas, enhancing ideas, and project execution.

      ### Capturing Ideas

      With more and more work occuring on digital platforms like [Slack](https://slack.com/apps/A02JKS7S2RL-brightidea?tab=more_info) and [Microsoft Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200002795?tab=Overview), it is inevitable that employees are going to think of and discuss ideas while interacting on those channels. Unfortunately most of these ideas are ultimately lost in the never-ending chat stream never to be revisted, or are forgotten when a virtual meeting ends.

      It's also no secret that we wont always get our best ideas during the confines of the 8 hour workday. We built a [Brightidea skill for Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Brightidea-Inc-Home/dp/B07HRKJ62J) and [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000009d03d1b1cd?hl=en-US) in order to make capturing ideas on-the-go or off-hours possible in mere seconds via voice integration. In this way Brightidea serves as your external brain--ideas are safely saved to your inbox to expand or organize when your schedule permits.

      Prefer to capture your idea by email? We also built email submission flows, known as Magic Inbox, to collect ideas at a single, easy-to-remember inbox: my@brightidea.com. This amazingly simple UX supports extensive company detection, IP & data protection, idea routing, and even new user registration flows. While there is major complexity hidden behind the scenes, all a user needs to remember is "My Brightidea."

      ### Project Management Integrations

      While Brightidea does provide project management tools in the Labs product, they are primarily geared towards zero-to-one innovation projects with small teams. One of the top user requests was integration with apps like Jira, Asana, Monday.com, etc. We built a native Jira integration, a bridge to Zapier, and general purpose rules-triggered outgoing webhooks to make all of this possible.
