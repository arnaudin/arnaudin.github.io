      I started at Brightidea as a Senior Product Designer but soon transitioned into a hybrid Design/Product Management role as I became more involved with defining strategy and requirements.
      
      ## Feature Design: Idea Management Fundamentals

      I began by focusing on the core needs of idea management users, including managers, sponsors, moderators, and administrators.

      As our customers matured and their innovation programs grew more complex, they faced new challenges in managing interconnected systems of programs and processes. To address these evolving needs, I focused on enhancing capabilities related to:

      - Discovery across the system:
        - Tagging
        - Categorization
        - Related ideas
        - Advanced search
      - Flow of ideas between activities: 
        - Sharing 
        - Moving ideas
        - Copying or duplicating ideas
      - Evolution
        - Spinning out new, related ideas
        - Linking ideas
        - Merging duplicate or similar ideas

Previously users were likely to get errors and failures if they attempted to move more than 20 ideas at a time. The operation could also take minutes to complete, and it was unclear if data would be lost or hidden as a result of the operation. We addressed these issues and more in the updated version.'

Here is a solution for parent-child merging of ideas—essentially all ideas are preserved as individuals, given a hierarchical relationship, and exhibit corresponding behavior & messaging throughout the platform.'

      ## Seamless Integrations for Enhanced Productivity

      To maximize the value of our platform and support our customers' diverse workflows, I led the development of various integrations with popular tools and platforms. These integrations streamline key tasks, such as capturing ideas, enriching brainstorming sessions, and managing project execution.

      **Capture Ideas Where They Happen**

      Recognizing that ideas often emerge during everyday interactions, we developed integrations with platforms like [Slack](https://slack.com/apps/A02JKS7S2RL-brightidea?tab=more_info) and [Microsoft Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200002795?tab=Overview). These tools enable users to effortlessly save ideas from chats. This transforms fleeting thoughts into actionable ideas with minimal friction and no switching of platforms.

      **Capture Ideas on the Go with Voice Integration**

      Inspiration can strike at any moment, even outside of work hours. With Brightidea's voice integration for [Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Brightidea-Inc-Home/dp/B07HRKJ62J) and [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000009d03d1b1cd?hl=en-US), users can capture those fleeting ideas instantly, hands-free. Simply speak your idea, and Brightidea will securely store it in a personal repository for later review and development.

      **Never Lose an Idea with Email Submission**

      Prefer to jot down your ideas in writing? Brightidea's Magic Inbox provides a simple and secure way to capture ideas via email. Send your thoughts to *my@brightidea.com*, and our amazingly simple UX backed by Brightidea's intelligent system will automatically:

      - Detect your company and route your idea accordingly

      **Project Management Integrations**

      To address a top customer request, we provided project management integration with apps like Jira, Asana, Monday.com, etc. I designed and managed the development of a native Jira integration, a bridge to Zapier, and a rules-triggered outgoing webhook feature to help automate customer worklows and extend Brightidea's capabilities beyond idea management.
