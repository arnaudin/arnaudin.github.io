intro: |
  I enjoy making things, and making things better. These are a handful of small 3D printing and CNC projects from my time at Autodesk (where I had access to amazing workshops at [Pier 9](https://www.instructables.com/Overview-Access-to-Autodesk-Pier-9-Workshop/)). Almost everything digital was done with Fusion 360.

      ### Bike Light Mount

      When carrying loads on a front rack, a handlebar light mount is virtually useless. After several prototypes, I settled on a design that could be easily mounted at the front of my rack with an M5 bolt. Eventually it would be cool to CNC this from metal.

      ### Bike Bell Mount

      A desired bell could not be mounted on a particular handlebar setup, so I designed and printed this extender to work with an existing mount.

      ### Coffee Grinder Hack

      The Hario Skerton is a good hand grinder for the price, but develops a wobble over time due to the wear of the metal shaft against a plastic part at a single point of contact. Ultimately this leads to uneven coffee grind sizes. 

      I designed this simple pair of parts to hug the shaft at a second, lower point of contact. This prevents the assembly from wobbling, thus reducing wear and keeping the grind size consistent.

      ### Hand Strap Mounting System

      How might we attach a safe, comfortable strap to a bodysurfing handplane so it doesn't get lost in the surf? It should be adjustable, strong, buoyant, and resistant to salt water.

      I am experimenting with custom kevlar/nylon composite prints. These are super strong and light. I also have designs I may machine from wood or metal in the future.

      ## CNC Projects

      Having completed the [beginners course](http://www.instructables.com/id/Learn-CNC-The-Hard-Way/) on CNC at Autodesk's Pier 9, here are some starter projects I have been working on. 

      ### Handplanes

      A bodysurfing handplane is a small supportive device worn on your hand. Depending on size and shape it can be used to more easily get barreled, help with optimal position on the wave face, and/or get more speed in the water. 

      This handplane was cut out on a ShopBot. From there, I used a orbital and belt sanders to refine the shape. More iterations are needed.

      ### Custom Chocolates

      For a unique gift, I machined a positive of my design from wax on the Othermill, and then created a foodsafe silicone mold negative from that to make custom chocolates.

      This gift was a hit on all levels!

      ### Generative Design for Additive Manufacturing

      I am fascinated by the potential of generative design to enable a new era of design and manufacturing. It's still early, but this is a great example of humans working with computers to create efficient, novel designs. 

      To get familiar with the tools, I have been exploring [generative designs](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/generative-design-aeropress-plunger) for an [Aeropress](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/aeropress-coffee-maker) plunger (silver part). In this case, the algorithm was prevented from adding material in a sphere-shaped region right at the center of the standard plunger. You can see how it branched around while maintaining sufficient support for the material and loads.
