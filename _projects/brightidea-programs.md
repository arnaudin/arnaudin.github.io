intro: |
  I was the **Product & Design Lead** on a five person team within Brightidea's own innovation lab. We were challenged to unlock new growth potential by expanding down-market. This involved developing new innovation methodologies, products, services, and PLG approaches.

      ## Approach
      
      Distanced from the core business and reporting to the CEO, our lab team truly was a startup-within-a-startup. We borrowed heavily from Y Combinator and Paul Graham for our approach:

      - [Launch fast and let ideas evolve](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html), aka "action produces information"
      - Aim for [5-7% week-over-week growth (WOW)](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)
      - "[Do things that dont scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)"
      - [Talk to customers!](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/898476047263518720)
      
      <br>
      Over the course of a year our team:

      - Developed a new methology to jumpstart employee innovation, *Innovation Program Management (IPM)*
      - Launched & iterated a product founded in this methodology, *Programs Pro*--that eventually rolled into [Brightidea Programs](https://www.brightidea.com/product/programs/)
      - Prototyped a *product-led growth (PLG)* motion that informed our approach with subsequent Idea Box and Whiteboard products

      <br>

      ## Product Highlights

      **A New Homepage Experience**
      
      Being small, fast, and close-to-the-customer our rate of learning was rapid. First insight: deployment of our legacy products took too long and was error prone. We developed an "app-like" experience out of the box, as opposed to the heavy site-builder and content management system that was typical. This offered admins a much simpler way to configure, brand, theme, and onboard users while those end-users recieved a personalized, easy-to-use experience.

      **A New Innovation App**
      
      We also observed that customers were bending our templated problem solving and optimization crowd-sourcing challenges to do more open-ended exploration of market opportunities. We developed a new innovation app around this use case called [Explore](https://www.brightidea.com/product/explore/), and packaged it in the product alongside the existing Solve & Optimize apps.

      **Always-on, Personal Idea Management**

      The types of innovation programs recommended in IPM are timebound by design, with start & end dates as opposed to being always-on. This keeps them focused, manageable, and impactful with clear milestones defined upfront. We had previously watched new, small customers fail under always-on suggestion boxes so our methodology intentionally avoided these pitfalls. However, this was a common point of friction in sales.

      We ended up developing a new concept called "My Ideas" that allows employees to capture & manage ideas in a personal repository, and later submit them to programs when the opportunity arises (e.g. a biannual hackathon). This solves the problem of "anytime anywhere" ideas, while avoiding unecessary burden on program managers. With objections now neutralized, sales efficiency & success improved drastically, and we filled a longtime product gap.

      **The Pitch Program**
      
      Finally, we conceived a general-purpose recurring program to ensure ongoing customer success--the Pitch Program. This is a scalable competition in the style of Shark Tank, great for engaging employees in order to find the most impactful ideas. I presented "How To Run a Successful Pitch Program" at [Synthesize 2018](https://synthesize.brightidea.com/), and we also developed the content into an ebook for customers and prospects.

Strategy to scale beyond $10M ARR. Expand TAM by moving down market. 

find a whole new way to sell. In our pre-PLG days, we were running a classic B2B enterprise SaaS model. Our initial deal size was typically between $50K and $75K, and both the product and the sales process were pretty complex. Our product offers a lot of custom CSS options, which factored into every sales conversation. The sales cycle for these kinds of deals runs about 4 to 6 months and involves a classic 2010-style marketing stack: Google Ads, LinkedIn, HubSpot, content marketing, Salesforce, inside sales, and demos.

Use Brightidea Programs to drive innovative thinking in your organization and deliver impact quickly with minimal resources.

Jumpstart Employee Innovation
Innovation programs are a common place to start the innovation journey because they drive innovative thinking in an organization and deliver impact quickly with minimal resources. Usually, these are idea challenges, prototyping events (i.e. hackathons), and pitch competitions. By helping to run these initiatives, our Programs product enables the Head of Innovation Programs to jumpstart employee innovation and enjoy three important benefits:

Fostering a culture that engages employees in innovation
Running repeatable processes that build momentum for the innovation process

Creating measurable business impact from implementing great ideas
Within our Programs product suite are eight apps; each runs a different type of innovation activity. With this new release, weâ€™ve added the Explore app for companies that want to explore ideas that address a market opportunity, with the goal of delivering greater value to their customers with an existing business model. You might, for example, seek to target younger customers in addition to your current customer base. With Explore, you can spearhead a company-wide discussion on how to provide value to this new market segment where they spend the most time: on mobile devices and social media.
