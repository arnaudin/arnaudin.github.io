      As Product & Design Lead in Brightidea's innovation lab, I was responsible for the development and launch of "Programs Pro," a new product designed to expand our reach into the mid-market. Over the course of a year, I led a series of product experiments to refine methodologies that empower small teams within large organizations to generate and implement impactful ideas within their departments. This eventually culminated in [Brightidea Program](https://www.brightidea.com/product/program/) becoming the company's leading product in terms of sales.

      ## Responsibilities
      - Collaborated with the General Manager and Sales/Marketing Lead to conduct market research, analyze customer needs, and develop a comprehensive product strategy and roadmap that guided the development work
      - Directly configured, templatized, and packaged new workflows on the Brightidea platform, enabling new small-team use cases
      - Designed and collaborated with the Engineering Lead to develop new features and a streamlined set up experience, resulting in 10x reduction in onboarding time

      ## Mission and Goal
      To further our company mission of "creating a world where the best ideas win," our team focused on democratizing innovation by empowering _every_ team to contribute their best ideas. We aimed to expand Brightidea's reach into the mid-market by offering tailored, cost-effective solutions. This strategic shift would make our powerful innovation platform accessible to a wider audience, ultimately driving greater innovation impact.

      ## Guiding Principles
      As a startup-within-a-startup reporting directly to the CEO, our guiding principles were borrowed heavily from Y Combinator and Paul Graham:

      - [Talk to customers!](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/898476047263518720)
      - [Launch fast and let ideas evolve](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html), aka "action produces information"
      - Target [5-7% week-over-week growth (WOW)](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)
      - [Do things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)

      ## Outcomes

      To successfully expand into the mid-market, we focused on delivering affordable solutions with streamlined onboarding and self-guided learning resources. Over the course of a year, we achieved the following:

      - Developed Innovation Program Management (IPM), a new methodology designed to accelerate employee-driven innovation within smaller teams. This framework provided the tools to get started with innovation management, and templates for running the highest-impact innovation activities. 
      - Launched Programs Pro, a product based on the IPM methodology, and iteratively improved it based on user feedback. This evolved into Brightidea Programs, which became the company's top-selling product, demonstrating the strong market demand for accessible innovation solutions.
      - Created a blueprint and playbook for product-led growth (PLG) at Brightidea, enabling self-service adoption and organic growth. This approach was later implemented for Idea Box and Whiteboard, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple product lines.

      For more behind-the-scenes on how our innovation lab paved the path to PLG, see our CEO's article on [productled.org](https://www.productled.org/blog/how-brightideas-innovation-lab-paved-the-path-to-plg).

      ## Product Highlights

      **New Homepage Experience**

      Our legacy product used a CMS and site builder that was slow, hard to use, and error prone. We developed the seeds of a new Home page consisting of a personalized feed and built-in onboarding.

      **A New Innovation App: Explore**
      
      We observed users bending our templated optimization crowd-sourcing challenge to facilitate open-ended exploration of new market opportunities, so developed a tailored app around this use case called [Explore](https://www.brightidea.com/product/explore/).

      **Always-on, Personal Idea Management**

      Employees often have brilliant ideas outside of formal innovation activities. "My Ideas" provides a dedicated space to capture and nurture those sparks of inspiration whenever they strike.

      This personal idea repository empowers employees to:

      - Capture ideas instantly: Jot down thoughts, add photos, save links, ensuring that no brilliant idea gets lost
      - Organize and develop concepts: Categorize ideas, add notes and attachments, and refine concepts over time
      - Submit to innovation programs: Easily share ideas with colleagues or submit them to relevant programs when the time is right, such as hackathons, problem-solving challenges, or optimization programs

      **The Pitch Program**
      
      Finally, we conceived a central, recurring program to ensure ongoing customer success that we named The Pitch Program. This is a scalable competition in the style of Shark Tank, great for engaging employees in order to find the most impactful ideas. I presented "How To Run a Successful Pitch Program" at [Synthesize 2018](https://synthesize.brightidea.com/), and we also developed the content into an ebook for customers and prospects. The existing Pitch app was refined to support a programmatic approach, and a roadmap was developed for future updates.

      Inspired by the popular "Shark Tank" format, The Pitch Program is a scalable competition designed to engage employees and uncover the most impactful ideas within your organization. It provides a structured framework for soliciting big ideas and funding winning projects.

      To support our customers in running successful Pitch Programs, we developed a comprehensive set of resources, including:

      - A presentation on best practices: "How To Run a Successful Pitch Program" presented at Synthesize 2018.
      - An informative ebook: A downloadable guide for customers and prospects.
      - Enhanced app functionality: The Pitch app was updated to support a recurring approach and improved executive reporting

Strategy to scale beyond $10M ARR. Expand TAM by moving down market. 

find a whole new way to sell. In our pre-PLG days, we were running a classic B2B enterprise SaaS model. Our initial deal size was typically between $50K and $75K, and both the product and the sales process were pretty complex. Our product offers a lot of custom CSS options, which factored into every sales conversation. The sales cycle for these kinds of deals runs about 4 to 6 months and involves a classic 2010-style marketing stack: Google Ads, LinkedIn, HubSpot, content marketing, Salesforce, inside sales, and demos.

Use Brightidea Programs to drive innovative thinking in your organization and deliver impact quickly with minimal resources.

Jumpstart Employee Innovation
Innovation programs are a common place to start the innovation journey because they drive innovative thinking in an organization and deliver impact quickly with minimal resources. Usually, these are idea challenges, prototyping events (i.e. hackathons), and pitch competitions. By helping to run these initiatives, our Programs product enables the Head of Innovation Programs to jumpstart employee innovation and enjoy three important benefits:

Fostering a culture that engages employees in innovation
Running repeatable processes that build momentum for the innovation process

Creating measurable business impact from implementing great ideas
Within our Programs product suite are eight apps; each runs a different type of innovation activity. With this new release, we’ve added the Explore app for companies that want to explore ideas that address a market opportunity, with the goal of delivering greater value to their customers with an existing business model. You might, for example, seek to target younger customers in addition to your current customer base. With Explore, you can spearhead a company-wide discussion on how to provide value to this new market segment where they spend the most time: on mobile devices and social media.
