      Unlock real-time team brainstorming and ideation with [Brightidea Whiteboard](https://www.brightidea.com/product/whiteboard/), the newest addition to our enterprise idea management platform. 
      
      **Role:** As Product Lead, I worked directly with the CEO to define product vision and strategy, then oversaw the design and development of the initial zero-to-one version of Whiteboard.

      My key contributions and responsibilities included:
      - Define clear product vision and strategy, to establish team alignment and product direction
      - Conduct and analyze user, market, competitor, and trend research
      - Create, prioritize, and manage the product roadmap and backlog to ensure user and business impact
      - Establish and drive an efficient development cadence to deliver high-quality releases on schedule
      - Collaborate closely with the marketing team to plan and execute successful product launch
      
      Read about the initial launch on the Brightidea blog, [A Better Way To Brainstorm](https://www.brightidea.com/blog/fall-release-2021/), and check out the official launch video:

      **Problem:** While our enterprise-ready platform excelled at asynchronous idea collection, we recognized a critical gap in our offering: real-time brainstorming and ideation. Competitors like Mural and Miro were capturing this essential market segment. The shift to remote work during the global pandemic further emphasized this need, as in-person brainstorming sessions migrated to digital platforms.

      **Solution:** We set out to create a powerful yet intuitive real-time ideation tool to seamlessly integrate with our existing innovation management platform. This ensured that users could not only brainstorm effectively but continue to manage their ideas within a unified ecosystem.

      The demo videos below showcase the key features we developed and delivered over two quarterly releases, empowering users to:

      - **Collaborate seamlessly**: Work together in real-time on an infinite canvas, with features like shared cursors, follower mode, and huddles for focused discussions
      - **Visualize ideas effortlessly**: Utilize a rich set of tools, including lines, shapes, text, images, sticky notes, and a freehand pen, to bring concepts to life
      - **Boost engagement**: Add personality and fun to brainstorming sessions with emojis and stickers
      - **Save time with templates**: Leverage pre-designed templates for workshops and activities, from brainstorming sessions to retrospectives
      - **Manage the entire innovation lifecycle**: Seamlessly transfer ideas between whiteboards and our enterprise innovation platform
      - **Enjoy a user-friendly experience**: Benefit from simple sharing options, intuitive access controls, and free trials to explore the platform's full potential

      This powerful integration completes Brightidea as the only platform you need to manage the entire innovation lifecycle, from initial spark of an idea to measuring implementation impact.
