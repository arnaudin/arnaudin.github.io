      [Brightidea Whiteboard](https://www.brightidea.com/product/whiteboard/) fills a gap in the Brightidea idea management platform with native whiteboards for real-time team brainstorming & ideation. This missing puzzle piece makes Brightidea a unique all-in-one solution for end-to-end idea management.
      
      **Role:** I served as Product Lead for v1 of Whiteboard, leading a team of backend Rust developers, frontend developers, and designers to deliver this brand-new product on a cutting-edge WebAssembly technology stack. I managed the roadmap, development cadence, and product releases. 
      
      Read about the initial launch on the Brightidea blog, [A Better Way To Brainstorm](https://www.brightidea.com/blog/fall-release-2021/), and check out the launch/demo video:

      ## Product

      The demo vidoes below offer an overview of the product capabilities. From the initial release through two quarterly updates we build a v1 whiteboarding product with:
        - Infinite canvas - no constraints on ideation and collaboration
        - Multiplayer - share, follow, huddle--collaboration at the core
        - Lines, shapes, text, images, and pen - all the building blocks you need for visualizing ideas
        - Sticky notes - capture thoughts and ideas like you would in person
        - Emojis & stickers - bringing fun and humanity to whiteboards
        - Templates - jump in right away, from workshops to retros
        - Brightidea integration - transfer ideas bi-directionally with our innovation platform
