      [Brightidea Whiteboard](https://www.brightidea.com/product/whiteboard/) rounds out the Brightidea idea management platform with native whiteboards for real-time team brainstorming & ideation. We have built an all-in-one solution for end-to-end idea management that cannot be found anywhere else. 
      
      **Role:** I served as Product Lead for v1 of Whiteboard, leading a team of backend Rust developers, frontend developers, and designers to deliver this brand new product on a cutting edge WebAssembly technology stack. 
      
      Read about the initial launch on the Brightidea blog, "[A Better Way To Brainstorm](https://www.brightidea.com/blog/fall-release-2021/)," and check out the launch/demo video:
