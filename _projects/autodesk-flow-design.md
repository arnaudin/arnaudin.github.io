intro: |
  [Flow Design](https://www.autodesk.com/products/flow-design/overview) is a virtual wind tunnel that makes airflow simulation accessible to architects, product designers, and students (not just analysts and engineers). 
  
  The goal of this project was to drastically simplify flow simulation so that more people can understand how their designs will perform in the real world. Most people can understand the concept of a wind tunnel, but don't know the first thing about computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or finite element analysis (FEA). All of the complexity lives behind the scenes with Flow Design.

      I served as Lead Designer for Flow Design....
      
      Flow Design not only simplifies the mental model, but also introduces near-real-time simulation to 
      
      Flow Design embraces the mental model of a wind tunnel familiar. Prior to Flow Design, flow simulation required users to approach the software with an understanding of the system model of computation fluid dynamics and finite element analysis. We aimed to disrupt the "old school" by putting the user first.
      
      The design strategy was for Flow Design to feel light weight and playful to encourage hands-on design exploration.

      ## Role
      
      Responsibilities included:

      - Design strategy
      - User research
      - Heuristic evaluation
      - User stories
      - Wireframes and mockups
      - Refining HTML/CSS layout
      - Visual design (icons, UI components)

      Before Flow Design was released as a full commercial product, it existed as an experimental tech preview to find product-market fit called Project Falcon.

      I provided high-level design guidance, basic research, and usability evaluation for Project Falcon which was intended to be a flexible bare bones experiment to gage demand. For example, the radial menu pictured here wasn't perfect on any one platform, but was part of a multi-build approach that allowed us to simultaneous release and test for both mobile & desktop, touch & mouse.

      ## Impact
      
      The product has seen commercial success, and Roopinder Tara, Director of Content at ENGINEERING.com [called](http://www.worldcadaccess.com/blog/2014/08/autodesk-flow-design-the-easiest-to-use-cfd-program-ever.html) Flow Design the "*easiest-to-use CFD program ever.*" 
      
      The thing I love about designing products to empower people is that they will inherently be used in unpredictable ways. For example, Flow Design and Autodesk Simulation provided the technology behind the Fox Weather Trax wind simulation at Superbowl XLVIII.

      ## In the Wild
      As a testament to the ease of use, elementary school students around the country were introduced to Flow Design on [National Youth Science Day](http://academy.autodesk.com/4h), as part of a rocket building activity. I volunteered at one of these events in California, and was unbelievably excited to find that the learners required no explanation to simulate their rockets!

      I also recently happened upon Flow Design [in the wild](https://limar.com/air-revolution/) while in the market for a new bike helmet.
