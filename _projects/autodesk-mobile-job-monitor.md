intro: |
  Users have been able to run large simulations in the cloud using Autodesk Simulation 360 since 2012. There has been an inherent limitation that these simulation jobs can only be monitored and managed from the source machine--often a desktop engineering computer. 
  
  Mobile Job Monitor provides a simple way to check progress and status of cloud simulations, which may take hours or sometimes even days to complete. A typical workflow is that an engineer will submit several jobs to solve in the afternoon before leaving the office, and will want monitor them that evening as they run.
