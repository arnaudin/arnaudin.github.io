      **Role:** This was a design-led visioning project stemming directly from user feedback and journey mapping observations. I designed the workflow, created mockups, and built a simple prototype in conjunction with an Android development course I was taking. (The app read static data rather than live via API, and was never productized.)

      **Problem:** Users have been able to run simulations in the cloud using Autodesk Simulation 360 since 2012. There has been an inherent limitation that these simulation jobs can only be monitored and managed from the source machine—often a desktop engineering computer that remains in the office.
      
      **Solution:** Mobile Job Monitor provides a simple way to check the progress and status of cloud simulations, which may take hours or sometimes even days to complete. 
      
      A typical workflow is that an engineer will submit several simulation jobs to solve in the afternoon before leaving the office, and will want to monitor them that evening as they run. If something unexpected occurs they could often make a quick fix, resubmit the job, and still have results in the morning.
