    <p class="projects-intro type-level-1">Delivering Value with Design</p>
    <blockquote style="margin: 0em;" class="projects-intro type-level-3">"The most important single thing is to focus obsessively on the customer." - Jeff Bezos</blockquote>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">This core belief underpins my approach to UX and product design. It's about understanding the 'why' behind user needs and crafting solutions that not only meet, but exceed expectations.</p>
    <blockquote style="margin: 0em;" class="projects-intro type-level-3">"Design is the rendering of intent."</blockquote>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">I've found this definition from Jared Spool to be the most succinct description of what we do as UX Designers.</p> 
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">It's easy to see how this applies to process at a meta-level. Developing a process must be a contexual and intentional design exercise itself–my approach will always be to define a path that will clarify intent, align teams, derisk decisions, and ultimately deliver exceptional value to users and stakeholders.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0em;" class="projects-intro type-level-2">A Human-Centered, Data-Informed Approach</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">My process is rooted in human-centered design principles, honed over more than a decade of designing software in startups and enterprises. I am a LUMA Certified Practitioner in Human-Centered Design, so am familiar with that toolset which provides incredible range.

    </div>         -->
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">With a background and education in Aerospace Engineering (BS, Virginia Tech), I blend this humanist approach with a unique perspective in rigorous, analytical problem solving. I get familiar with the technical side of the problem space, am comfortable digging into data, and have always experienced natural collaboration with engineering teams, as I am able to naturally speak their language.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin: 0em;" class="projects-intro type-level-2">Design Process</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">While each project is unique, my approach generally follows these key phases:</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Understanding & Discovery </b><br>This crucial step involves immersing myself in the problem space. I conduct thorough research, employing a range of methodologies as necessary, like interviews, contextual inquiry, participatory research, usability testing, and/or competitive analysis to gain insights into user needs, behaviors, and motivations. I work closely with stakeholders to understand business objectives and technical constraints.</p>

        </figure>
    </div> -->
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Definition & Ideation </b><br>Based on the research and stakeholder interviews, I identify the core problem(s), synthesize insights into hypotheses, and begin to generate potential solution directions. I use a variety of ideation techniques, including brainstorming, sketching, shaping, and wireframing–ensuring to explore a range of approaches. Information architecture and layouts will start to take shape.</p>

        </figure>
    </div> -->
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Mockups & Prototypes </b><br>I create solution mockups, ranging from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity mockups to interactive prototypes, to evaluate, test, and refine the promising solutions. I believe in iterative design, continuously gathering feedback and making adjustments based on testing results. Visuals and interactions continue to get more refined through the process. </p>

        </figure>
    </div> -->
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Implementation </b><br>Once the design is finalized, I work closely with development teams to ensure seamless implementation. I provide detailed design specifications and assets, and I remain involved and flexible throughout the development process to address any questions or issues that may arise. I have experience writing requirements and participating in user-acceptance testing.</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Iteration, Optimization, & Improvement </b><br>Even after a product is launched, the design process continues. I monitor user feedback and usage data to identify areas for improvement, and continue to iterate on the design to optimize the user experience. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0em;" class="projects-intro type-level-2">The Value of Repeatable Process</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">Having spent time building innovative software for innovation management, I know that delivering value is essential. This is what underlies UX and what differentiates innovation from invention–it's not just discovering something new, it's delivering new sources of value to users, customers, and society. </p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">A repeatable design process and toolbox of proven research methods provides a powerful foundation to predictably identify opportunities and create value. To reiterate, this approach derisks product decisions, builds alignment within product development and leadership teams, and ultimately, creates products that are both useful and delightful to use.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin: 0em;" class="projects-intro type-level-2">Influences</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">This is not a comprehensive list, but these are some of my most impactful and favorite influences, whose teachings I have internalized in my own approach:</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Don Norman </b><br><br>Don Norman's seminal work, "The Design of Everyday Things," was one of my first resources when I began considering a career in design. Fortunately, this started me down a path deeply rooted in user-centered principles. His emphasis on discoverability, feedback, and the importance of understanding a user's mental model shaped how I think about creating intuitive and usable interfaces. He taught me that good design should be invisible, seamlessly guiding the user towards their goals without frustration or confusion. Ultimately the measure of a design's success lies in its ability to empower the user. </p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Alan Cooper </b><br><br>Cooper's work has been instrumental in shaping my design philosophy, particularly as an engineer-turned-designer, a path he forged. His book "About Face" provided a framework for understanding the profound disconnect that often exists between how engineers build software and how users actually experience it.</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">I found his invention of personas to be a profound insight as a tool to bridge this gap, despite their frequent misuse. Personas allowed me to step outside of my own perspective and empathize with users whose needs and mental models often differed vastly from my own. 
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">Cooper's focus on humanizing technology resonated deeply, pushing me to prioritize user goals and create interfaces that are not just functional but also respectful, accommodating, and delightful. His influence has instilled in me the belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around, and that good design is fundamentally about understanding and respecting the user. </p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>John Maeda </b><br><br>Circa 2017, I attended a presentation by John Maeda in the Autodesk Gallery and was first introduced to his concept of "computational design," which profoundly shaped my perception of software design in the age of the internet. Maeda's distinction between classical design, design thinking, and computational design highlighted the unique power of leveraging computers and networks to create dynamic systems for millions of users. This pushed me beyond thinking of static interfaces and screens, to see myself as an architect of living, evolving digital ecosystems.</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3">Also, as another engineer-turned-designer, his multidisciplinary perspective and leaps between disparate roles/industries has inspired me to lean into my strengths and follow interests as a T-shaped generalist. In another talk, he eschewed describing his own "superpower," and instead noted that he resonated more with a Batman approach of having a utility belt and cave full of tools to get any job done.</p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Jakob Nielsen </b><br><br>Jakob Nielsen's pioneering work in usability, particularly his development of the ten usability heuristics, has had a lasting influence on my design approach. These heuristics–encompassing principles like visibility of system status, user control & freedom, and error prevention–have become an indispensable tool in my process. Internalizing these guidelines has enabled me to create more intuitive and user-friendly software interfaces, always evaluating design decisions through the lens of user experience. The emphasis on good usability has guided me to create products that are efficient, effective, and satisfying to use. His heuristics are one of the most useful and practical frameworks I've encountered. </p>
    <p class="projects-intro type-level-3"><b>Buckminster Fuller </b><br><br>Buckminster Fuller is one visionary from outside the software world that I must include. His overall design philosophy, emphasizing foresight, innovation, and an interconnected approach to problem-solving is truly inspiring. I am influenced by his drive to solve complex problems through holistic systems-thinking while challenging conventional assumptions. Doing more with less, he managed to find comprehensive solutions that create a better world through their efficiency, sustainability, and elegance. His legacy encourages me to consider the broader impact of design on the world. And he had so many ground-breaking ideas–who doesn't love a geodesic dome?</p>
