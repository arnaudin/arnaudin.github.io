intro: |

  As a practicing designer with a background in engineering and over 9 yrs of professional experience in software product development, I am able to balance creative and analytical approaches to define, explore, and solve complex problems. I have designed commercial software for desktop, web, and mobile. I have personally developed free and experimental apps, so have empathy for the challenges software developers face.

  I consider myself a technologist with a humanist approach. I care deeply about people, believe in the value of the human experience, and am a technology enthusiast. My purpose is to leverage design, engineering, and technology to empower and serve people in productive, meaningful ways.

  I have hands-on experience in all phases of the modern product development process. I can lead product design, support myself & team with research and testing, facilitate the innovation process, and act as a strategic partner. I am experienced with a variety of development methods from waterfall to agile, and always find a way to bring collaboration, human-centered design, and iterative learning into the process.

  I believe design should be used as an accelerator, differentiator, validator, and risk mitigator in the pursuit of the larger goals of the organization, so I am not afraid to resist design for designâ€™s sake.
