intro: |

  I am a full-stack product leader with over 14 years of experience shipping professional-grade software. Most recently, I held product leadership roles at Brightidea, where I led teams to build & launch B2B SaaS tools for corporate innovation management (e.g., [Brightidea Whiteboard](/projects/brightidea-whiteboard/)). 

  At my core, I am a problem solver. I studied engineering but have focused my career on human-centered design; thus, I can balance analytical and creative approaches to define, explore, and solve complex problems. 

  I love figuring out new, innovative products and helping take them from zero to one. However, I have extensive experience maintaining and evolving legacy products & platforms. I am a long-term, strategic thinker who doesn't settle for the quick fixâ€”unless the quick fix is what gets us to our goals most effectively. I get satisfaction from knowing my products are useful in the world.

  Throughout my career, I have worked across most roles on a modern software development team ranging from QA to Design to Product Management. I have designed applications & experiences spanning mobile, web, and desktop. As a PM, I led teams to launch cutting-edge web apps. I have conducted a wide range of user research and facilitated workshops. I have personally developed free & experimental programs and tackled large-scale engineering problems, so so I empathize with developers and the challenges they face..

  I believe design should be an accelerator, differentiator, validator, and risk mitigator in pursuing the organization's goals and *ultimately to serve customers*. Together we can leverage breakthroughs in design, engineering, and product development to forge a future where technology empowers people in productive, meaningful ways. As humans, we have the power and ability to shape the world around us into a better place.
